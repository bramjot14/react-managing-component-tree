### React Managing a Component Tree

Completed:
- Built a to-do list using parent and child components
- Practiced lifting state up to the parent component
- Passed functions as props to child components
- Triggered parent state updates from child events
- Used `filter()` to remove items immutably from state
- Strengthened understanding of unidirectional data flow in React
- Learned why callback functions are required for child-to-parent communication

Key Takeaway:
In React, state should live in the highest common parent. Child components should never modify state directly — instead, they communicate actions back to the parent using callback functions.
